# Plugn Store Demo

The purpose of this repo is to showcase the Plugn Store API integration with Sadcn UI and make the UI more reachable and user-friendly. This component can also be created with EasyBlock, but for demo purposes, I have used Shadcn UI components and rendered data. All data on the product page (server-side rendering) and store onfo (static site generation) is coming from the Plugn API.

## Tech Stack

1. Shadcn UI
2. Tailwind CSS
3. Plugn API (https://api.plugn.io/v2)

1. Clone the repo or download the code

2. Navigate to project folder
   `cd plugn`

3. Install dependencies
   `npm install`

4. Run the development server
   `npm run dev`

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
